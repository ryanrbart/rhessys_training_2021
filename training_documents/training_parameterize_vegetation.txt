Parameterizing vegetation 

For the next few weeks, we are going to switch gears. The goal with this next task is to have you start to parameterize a patch in the model that contains a conifer and an understory. The location is South Fork Tule River watershed at 2414 m. This patch has been previously parameterized without mortality turned on but it needs to be reparameterized with mortality. Our goal is to parameterize this vegetation while familiarizing ourselves with the vegetation and soil parameters.


Steps

1. Update your rhessys_training_2021 folder by pulling updates from the rhessys_training_2021 github repository.


2. Move training documents
cp rhessys_training_2021/training_documents/training_parameterize_vegetation.txt scripts/
cp rhessys_training_2021/training_documents/tule_patch_conifer_high.R scripts/
cp rhessys_training_2021/training_documents/tule_patch_conifer_high_post.R scripts/


3. Copy new clim files to ws_tule folder
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/clim/tule_pixel_8_1980_2016.base ws_tule/clim/
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/clim/tule_pixel_8_1980_2016.rain ws_tule/clim/
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/clim/tule_pixel_8_1980_2016.tmax ws_tule/clim/
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/clim/tule_pixel_8_1980_2016.tmin ws_tule/clim/
or 
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/clim/tule_pixel_8_1980_2016.* ws_tule/clim/


4. Copy new header file to ws_tule folder
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/worldfiles/patch_conifer_high.hdr ws_tule/worldfiles/


5. Copy tecfile
mkdir ws_tule/tecfiles/
cp rhessys_training_2021/ws_tule/tecfiles/patch_conifer_high.tec ws_tule/tecfiles/


6. Set up bin
mkdir ws_tule/bin
cp RHESSys/rhessys/rhessys7.2 ws_tule/bin


7. Run model via R
Open scripts/tule_patch_conifer_high.r and scripts/tule_patch_conifer_high_post.r in Rstudio


8. Run model via command line
ws_tule/bin/rhessys7.2 -w ws_tule/worldfiles/patch_conifer_high.world -whdr ws_tule/worldfiles/patch_conifer_high.hdr -t ws_tule/tecfiles/patch_conifer_high.tec -r ws_tule/flowtables/patch_conifer_high.flow -st 2000 10 1 1 -ed 2100 09 30 1 -pre ws_tule/out/patch_conifer_high -b -p -c -g -vmort_off -climrepeat
